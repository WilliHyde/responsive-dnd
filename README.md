**Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Character Sheet made in Bootstrap**

This is a responsively designed character sheet designed for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It is designed to be as simple and unintrusive as possible; a true paper replacement. The biggest challenge for this project is that I've only really played D&D twice. My knowledge of the mechanics is a tad limited. To that end, my friend Danny Martin deserves a producer credit for his constant help with this project. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let me know! -[@WilliHyde](https://twitter.com/WilliHyde)

**To do list:**
* Convert most of the sections into templates with Handelbars.js
* Convert the CSS over to SCSS.
* Set up a grunt file for a lot of this.
* Get the save and upload sections to function. The data will be saved and loaded in from a JSON file.

**Possible future features:**
* Cloud loading of JSON data file.
* Spell Sheet and Additional Character Information Sheet.
